                            It is not a plastic surgery, or cosmetic surgery, as the procedure involves transplantation of Melanocytes, 
                            which is not done by plastic surgeons and this procedure is now considered as a treatment modality for vitiligo and 
                            thus it also cannot be considered as cosmetic surgery.

                            Most people with vitiligo have no relatives with vitiligo. However, enough people with vitiligo do have parents, or 
                            siblings or children who develop vitiligo that a genetic factor does appear to exist.

                            Laser hair removal is permanent hair reduction, not permanent hair removal.  
                            It's not uncommon for patients to require maintenance treatments once a year, even after the 
                            area has been fully treated. The reason: The laser targets and destroys your current hair follicles, 
                            but new follicles can develop thanks to hormonal changes or shifts in weight.

                            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content id="deeplink2">
                            The procedure hurts-but not a lot. "It stings, It's universally described as a rubber band snapping against your skin." 
                            But it only stings for a millisecond-the time it takes for the laser to target your hair follicle and zap it away.
                            While your skin may be a little red and puffy after the procedure, you shouldn't feel any pain in the area by the time you leave the clinic.
