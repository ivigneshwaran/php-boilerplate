                    <p>Regardless of which area you're looking to de-fuzz, laser hair removal can help. 
                        In a matter of minutes, hair follicles are destroyed with minimal discomfort. 
                        Using highly concentrated energy, hair follicles are targeted and pulses of light are 
                        emitted. The laser's energy is attracted to the pigment of hair, the same way sunlight 
                        is attracted to darker clothing. For this reason, laser hair removal work best on those 
                        with dark, coarse hair and a fair complexion. However, people without this combination 
                        can still get great results. Unlike many of our competitors, Ideal Image offers multiple 
                        types of lasers in our centers to treat a variety of skin types and complexions, including 
                        those with darker skin tones. Everyone's skin is different, which is why we will customize 
                        your treatment package during your FREE consultation to ensure you achieve the best results possible.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to Prepare for Laser Hair Removal</strong></p>
                    <p>Laser hair removal is more than just ''zapping'' unwanted hair. It is a medical procedure that 
                        requires training to perform and carries potential risks. Before getting laser hair removal, 
                        you should thoroughly check the credentials of the doctor or technician performing the procedure.</p>
                    <p>If you are planning on undergoing laser hair removal, you should limit plucking, waxing, and 
                        electrolysis for six weeks before treatment. That's because the laser targets the hairs' 
                        roots, which are temporarily removed by waxing or plucking.</p>
                    <p>You should also avoid sun exposure for six weeks before and after treatment. 
                        Sun exposure makes laser hair removal less effective and makes complications after 
                        treatment more likely.</p>
                    <p><strong>What to Expect During Laser Hair Removal</strong></p> 
                    <p>Just before the procedure, your hair that will be undergoing treatment will be trimmed to a few millimeters 
                        above the skin surface. The laser equipment will be adjusted according to the color, thickness, and 
                        location of your hair being treated as well as your skin color.</p>
