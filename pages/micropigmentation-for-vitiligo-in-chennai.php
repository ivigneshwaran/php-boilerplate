                    <p>Micropigmentation involves implanting small particles of natural pigment under the skin similar to a tattoo. 
                    The procedure is sometimes called ‘permanent cosmetics.</p>
                    <p><strong>What you should know about micropigmentation for vitiligo:</strong></p>
                    <p>Micropigmentation is a technique in which minute, metabolically inert pigment granules are 
                    implanted below the epidermis for cosmetic and/or corrective enhancement. Typically two to four 
                    treatments are necessary. The process can be performed in a doctor’s office in less than two hours. 
                    Topical anesthetics are sometimes applied to keep the patient comfortable during the procedure. 
                    Pigments are individually mixed to match the patient’s skin. Results can be seen immediately, 
                    though full end results are not apparent for about three weeks.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to prepare for the procedure:</strong></p>
                    <p>Before the procedure, our dermatologist will review the patient’s medical history and conduct 
                    a physical exam. This is the time for the doctor and patient to discuss expectations, potential 
                    risks and outcomes of the procedure. It’s important to remember that micropigmentation skill levels 
                    vary widely. Patients should ask for references.</p>
