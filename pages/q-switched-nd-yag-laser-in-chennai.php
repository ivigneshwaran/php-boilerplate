                    <p>The Q Switched Nd:YAG is a type of laser technology useful in treating both superficial and 
                        deep skin discoloration. It produces 2 wavelengths, one in the infrared range (1064 nm) for 
                        deeper skin lesions and a second beam of 532 nm wavelengths which is useful for superficial skin lesions.</p>
                    <p>No matter how much we take care to reduce the signs of ageing, stubborn brown spots can be a give-away. 
                        Some know these by different names – age spots, freckles, lentigines, or liver spots. There are a 
                        range of different types of pigmentation which vary in appearance, what depth in the skin they lie, 
                        and how responsive they are to treatment.</p>
                    <p><strong>What are the Benefits of ND YAG Skin Treatment?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improve skin tone</li>
                        <li>Reduce rosacea and thread facial vein</li>
                        <li>Reduce facial wrinkles and fine lines</li>
                        <li>Treat sun damage including age spots and brown pigmentation</li>
                        <li>Firming and tightening the skin</li>
                        <li>Stimulate new collagen and elastin tissue production</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>How does ND YAG Laser work?</strong></p>
                    <p>ND YAG Laser comes in 2 wavelengths, 1064 nm and 532 nm. It is a non-ablative laser, which means 
                        that there is no break in skin tissue continuity during the treatment. It is designed to target 
                        pigment cells. This specific wavelength are absorbed preferentially by pigments (melanin) and the 
                        resultant heat will cause generation and propagation of waves that cause damage to the cells containing 
                        pigment. These damaged cells will then be cleared from the site resulting in lightening of the pigmented site.</p>
                    <p><strong>How is Q-switched Nd:YAG laser treatment perfomed?</strong></p>
                    <p>Q Switch Nd:YAG laser creates an invisible or green beam of light that specifically targets the 
                        brown pigment or melanin present in the dark spots without having any effect on the surrounding skin. 
                        The pigment absorbs the laser energy and gets fragmented within the skin’s tissues after which the 
                        body gets rid of the debris via a natural process called “phagocyctosis”.</p>
                    <p>This laser is able to reach deeper areas where topical hypopigmenting products, 
                        peels and other superficial treatments do not reach.</p>
